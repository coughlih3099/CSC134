For the final project CSC134

# Mythos Game Engine
My final was going to be creating a game with Raylib.
But I've been having too much fun building on top of Raylib to actually make a game.

### How to build
----
- mkdir build && cd build
- cmake ..
- make
- ./FinalProject

### Build the docs
In your build directory:
- cmake ..
- make docs
- firefox docs/html/index.html (assuming you're using firefox and the CLI)


### Run the tests
After building and while in the build directory:
./test/FinalProject_test
